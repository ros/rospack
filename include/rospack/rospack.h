\section overview Overview

\b librospack is the ROS stackage (stack/package) management library.

librospack is part dpkg, part pkg-config.  The main function of librospack is
to crawl through the stackages in ROS_ROOT and ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, read and
parse the \b manifest for each stackage, and assemble a complete
dependency tree for all stackages.

Using this tree, librospack can answer a number of queries about stackages and
their dependencies.  Common queries include:
 - find : return the absolute path to a stackage
 - depends : return a list of all of a stackage's dependencies
 - depends-on : return a list of stackages that depend on the given stackage
 - export : return flags necessary for building and linking against a package

librospack is intended to be cross-platform.

\subsection crawling Crawling algorithm
librospack crawls in the following order: the directory ROS_ROOT, followed by
the colon-separated list of directories ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, in the order they
are listed.

During the crawl, librospack examines the contents of each directory, looking
for a file called @b manifest.xml (for packages) or @b stack.xml (for stacks).
If such a file is found, the directory
containing it is considered to be a ROS stackage, with the stackage name
equal to the directory name.  The crawl does not descend further once a
manifest is found (i.e., stackages cannot be nested inside one another).

If a manifest is not found in a given directory, each subdirectory
is searched.  This subdirectory search is prevented if a file called @b
rospack_nosubdirs is found.  The directory itself is still searched for a
manifest, but its subdirectories are not crawled.

If multiple stackages by the same name exist within the search path, the
first one found wins.  It is strongly recommended that you keep stackages by
the same name in separate trees, each having its own element within
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  That way, you can deterministically control the search
order by the way that you specify ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  The search order
within a given element of ROS_PACKAGE_PATH can be unpredictably affected by
the details of how files are laid out on disk.

\subsection efficiency Efficiency considerations
librospack re-parses the manifest files and rebuilds the dependency tree
on each execution.  However, it maintains a cache of stackage directories in
ROS_HOME/rospack_cache (or ROS_HOME/rosstack_cache).
This cache is updated whenever there is a cache
miss, or when the cache is 60 seconds old.  You can change this timeout by
setting the environment variable ROS_CACHE_TIMEOUT, in seconds.  Set it to
0.0 to force a cache rebuild on every invocation of librospack.

librospack's performance can be adversely affected by the presence of very
broad and/or deep directory structures that don't contain manifest files.
If such directories are in librospack's search path, it can spend a lot of
time crawling them only to discover that there are no stackages to be found.
You can prevent this latency by creating a @b rospack_nosubdirs file in
such directories. If librospack seems to be running annoyingly slowly, you
can call profile(), which will print out the slowest trees
to crawl.

\subsection dependencies Minimal dependencies
Because librospack is the tool that determines dependencies, it must
have minimal dependencies.  librospack contains a copy of the TinyXML library,
and depends on Boost.  If gtest is available, then tests can be run.

\section codeapi Code API

librospack is used primarily in command-line tools (rospack and rosstack),
but can be used in other contexts.  See the API documentation for Rospack
and Rosstack.
